Welcome to S.O.N.I.A. Project Documentation
===========================================

Team SONIA (Système d’Opération Nautique Intelligent et Autonome), from École de technologie supérieure, is an undergraduate student association that builds an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to perform at the annual Robosub competition held in San Diego, California.
 
Since our beginning in 1999, we have developed 8 AUV prototypes with the goal of competing at the AUVSI and ONR’s International Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Competition.
  
At SONIA we love to share our idea and develop great collaboration with people around the world.

The code is open source, and available on github.
